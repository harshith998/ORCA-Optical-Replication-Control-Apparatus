This repository is all software/PCB schematics for the dynamic lighting system in the CASAR lab. In order to track unbiased nitrogen fixation levels, the light intensity inside their incubation vessel has to match environmental conditions. Our sensor module sends lux values to the lab module, which projects onto LED strips after feature extraction.
